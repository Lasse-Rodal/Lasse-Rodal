### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Lasse

I work in education and explore web development and automation as a creative outlet.

This GitHub profile is mostly a collection of personal projects, learning experiments, and fun little ideas I wanted to bring to life with code.

I'm currently focused on:
- Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- Small automation scripts in Python
- Exploring how things work under the hood

Most of this is just me tinkering and learning in my free time, so feel free to poke around, leave feedback, or say hi!
